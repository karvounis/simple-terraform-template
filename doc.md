# Template Terraform

This repo is a template to fast track the creating of Terraform repos.
It contains various pre-populated config files and a number of `.tf` files that you will definitely use.
Especially helpful for creation of Terraform modules.

This repo's README file is autogenerated using [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs)!
